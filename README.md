# Python
Everything interesting that have done in Python. Python is my programming language of choice, so any idea for a game or if I find something interesting in mathematics that I want to code, I do in Python.

## Math

* Linear Algebra (see README in that directory for more details)
* Fibonacci sequence generator
* GCD calculator
* Convert a number in base 10 to binary
* Using the "repeated squares" method to calculate the a^b (mod n) of large numebrs
* Checking if a number is a perfect square without a sqrt function

## Sorting
I have code many sorting algorithms in C, which are avaiable in the repository labeled C. Using NumPy and MatPlotLib, I have animated a subset of these sorting algorithms. I have animated

* Bubble Sort
* Cocktail Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
* Slow Sort
* Merge Sort
* Heap Sort
* Quick Sort
* Radix Sort

## TSP
TSP stands for "Traveling Salesman Problem". It is a famous problem in graph theory, which asks how to efficiently find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. In this directory I have included my implementation of a graph in Python as well as the following solutions to the TSP

* Nearest Neighbor
* Dijkstra

## Games
Games are always fun things to code in your free time. I have coded the following games.

* Tic Tac Toe       (Including AI)
* Chess             (Including AI)
* Poker

## Turtle
Turtle is a crude drawing tool in Python. I have coded a few things using it just for fun. I enjoy the intellectual excercise of figuring out the geometry to make everything connect. There is not much useful about any of this code however.

## Useful

### Syntax
There are many things that just require memorizing the syntax of the programming language in order to do.

* Reading files
* Writing files
* Getting arguments from the terminal
* sorting a CSV file
* Parallel processing
* Timing code
* HTTP requests
* Writing to a mysql database

### Data Structures
I have implemented many data structures in C, which are available in the repository labeled C. I have coded a subset of them in python as well.

* Stack
* Queue
* Heap
* Graph

### Miscellaneous

* Encryption
* Solution to Optimal Scheduling Problem

## One Liners File
Python has lambda notation for list generation, which can be useful. I think people generally over-use this notation however, sacraficing readability for brevity. I generally value readability of code, so I would never actually use these one-liners. However, I do enjoy the intellectual excercise of trying to figure out how to make them.
